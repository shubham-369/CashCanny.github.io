	OSLO: Norway will offer COVID-19 vaccines to all children aged five years and above, the government said on Friday (Jan 14).
<br><br>
	It had previously only offered vaccines to children aged 12 and older.
<br><br>
	"We are following the National Institute of Public Health's (FHI) recommendation, and will offer free vaccination to children where parents and guardians want it," Health Minister Ingvild Kjerkol said in a statement.
<br><br>
	About 90 per cent of adults in Norway have received at least two vaccine doses against COVID-19, according to FHI data.
